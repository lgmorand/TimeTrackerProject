## Categories

When tracking your time in EXSP, each labor entry must fit into one of these categories:

- Dispatch/delivery: VBD, EDE, ROSS, etc.
- Opportunity: any time you spend for a customer, including internal meetings such as scrum.
- Vacation: when you drink cocktails by the beach
- Training Taken
- General administration
- Support Presales: this one is **for Unified contract presales only**, don't use it when you do opportunity presale!
- Mentor / Community / Non-Sanctioned IP Dev: any IP reuse/meetup/RTFM
- Any other category is irrelevant for a CSA/CSAM

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
 Every categorie except dispatch/opportunity is considered as NOT customer-focused and you may appear as not spending enough time with customer. "Overhead" categories should not represent more than 30% of your time.

## Tagging events


## Custom categories

When you tag an event with the "opportunity" category, it will take a "random" opportunity from MSX (but one of yours!). It is OK for the management to track time on any opportunity but if you want to be more precise because you know that in the future, they may ask for more, you can tag a meeting with a specific opportunity. For that, the name of the category must have a specific format including the oppty ID.

Because it's boring to have to create it manually, the application helps you to create them through [the Settings of the application](./options/).
