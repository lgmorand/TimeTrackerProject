## Categories

When tracking your time in EXSP, each labor entry must fit into one of these categories:

- Dispatch/delivery: VBD, EDE, ROSS, etc.
- Opportunity: any time you spend for a customer, including internal meetings such as scrum.
- Vacation: when you drink cocktails by the beach
- Training Taken
- General administration
- Support Presales: this one is **for Unified contract presales only**, don't use it when you do opportunity presale!
- Mentor / Community / Non-Sanctioned IP Dev: any IP reuse/meetup/RTFM
- Any other category is irrelevant for a CSA/CSAM

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
 Every categorie except dispatch/opportunity is considered as NOT customer-focused and you may appear as not spending enough time with customer. "Overhead" categories should not represent more than 30% of your time.
