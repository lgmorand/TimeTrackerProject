### Ask for alias

When you start the application for the first time, it will ask for your Microsoft alias (i.e. "lomorand"). That's the only field the application cannot guess and needs to be provided.

### Configure categories

Once done, it will connect to your Outlook to create the missing categories. Because only taggued meetings are relevant, you'll need to tag your meetings with relevant categories and restart the app.
