### Watch the quick explanatory video

Create [a new agent pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues) in Azure DevOps. Then, create [the personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-linux?view=azure-devops#permissions) allowing access from the Agent to Azure DevOps.

### Download the last version


### Configure it

Just run the application by clicking the TimeTracker.exe icon. On first startup, you should have the configuration wizard which asks for you Microsoft alias (i.e.: "lomorand"). If you give the wrong alias, the application won't work, don't be stupid ;-)
